The “Air Mouse: Vision-Guided Hand Gesture Recognition for Cursor 
Control” project introduces an innovative, touchless solution for controlling a computer’s cursor using 
simple hand movements. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, this system eliminates the 
need for a physical mouse, allowing users to interact with their devices naturally. This approach is 
particularly beneficial for individuals with motor impairments, professionals delivering presentations, 
and those seeking a hygienic alternative to conventional input methods. 
The system utilizes OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe Hands for real-time hand tracking. A 
standard webcam captures the user’s hand movements, which are analyzed and translated into mouse 
functions such as cursor movement, clicking, and scrolling. Intuitive gestures, like bringing fingers 
together to mimic clicks, make the system user-friendly with minimal learning effort.
